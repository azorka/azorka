### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Angela and I am a NSF Office of Polar Programs Postdoctoral Fellow and Research Associate at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/). I earned my PhD as a [Dr. Nancy Foster Scholar](https://fosterscholars.noaa.gov/) from [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/).

My research focuses on the behavioral ecology of baleen whales, bioacoustics, and predator-prey interactions spanning the sub-Arctic to the Arctic. I am interested in how environmental and climate change may influence migration and behavior as well as anthropogenic threats. For this, I use biologging, AIS data, and long-term passive acoustic monitoring. I am also interested in spatial relationships between predators and prey and the impact of predation on coastal pelagic fish species. For this, I use active acoustics, trawls, and cetacean survey data to assess the strength of relationships and estimate consumption rates.
