### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Angela and I am a Research Associate at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/). I earned my PhD as a [Dr. Nancy Foster Scholar](https://fosterscholars.noaa.gov/) from [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/).

I use a variety of tools â€” including animal-mounted tags and seafloor hydrophones â€” to study baleen whale migration and ecology, and the threats they face in a human- and climate-impacted ecosystem. My research spans the sub-Arctic to the Arctic and mainly focuses on bowhead, blue, and humpback whales.
