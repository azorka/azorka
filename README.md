### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Angela and I am a contractor at [NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/southwest-fisheries-science-center). I earned my PhD as a [Dr. Nancy Foster Scholar](https://fosterscholars.noaa.gov/) from [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/).

My research focuses on the behavioral ecology of baleen whales and predator-prey interactions in the California Current Ecosystem. I am interested in how environmental and climate change may influence migration and behavior (e.g., feeding, calling, movement), and the multiplicative stressor of anthropogenic impacts. For this, I primarily use biologging and passive acoustic monitoring to assess whale movement and behavior. I am also interested in spatial relationships between predators and prey and the impact of predation on commercially important species. For this, I use active acoustics, trawls, and seabird and cetacean survey data to assess the strength of relationships and estimate consumption rates.
